## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

AI Deployment Engineer with ~5 years across consulting and enterprise delivery, focused on turning GenAI from demos into production adoption.

I build decision and automation systems that teams rely on in critical moments — including a real-time natural-perils map for the Command Centre that reduced disaster response decisions from days to hours, supporting outreach to millions of customers.

I ship AI end-to-end: from POCs to production systems.
Projects include a personalized news recommendation platform for News Corp and BrickAI — a production agentic property search app (speaker at Actuarial Summit 2025, ~200 attendees).

## EXPERIENCE

### IAG — Data Engineer (API, AI/LLM, Deployment)
Sydney, NSW | Sep 2025 – Present

#### Situational Awareness Map
- Built a real-time situational awareness map for natural perils used by senior decision-makers in the Command Centre. Reduced disaster response cycles from days to hours, supporting outreach at scale (millions of customers in 2025 QLD hail; tens of thousands of policies in 2026 VIC bushfires).
- Designed the geospatial data model (claims, policy, hazard layers) with ~30-minute refresh pipelines powering live dashboards.
- Deployed to Kubernetes (Helm) with CARTO + BigQuery; implemented CI/CD via GitHub Actions with production approval gates.

#### Home Health Check Platform
- Led the productionisation of the Home Health Check platform, converting a proof-of-concept into a secure, AI-enabled customer-facing risk intelligence system.
- Architected the cloud solution and secure access model, enforcing property-level, server-side authorization to ensure policyholders only access insights related to their insured assets (zero-trust design).
- Introduced AI-driven personalisation to convert structured risk data into tailored mitigation guidance, and implemented proactive notification mechanisms to surface emerging risks.

#### Data Product
- Extended the platform into reusable data services and MCP-enabled APIs for agent-based workflows.

### Dataly — Senior Data/AI Consultant
Sydney, NSW | Nov 2023 – Sep 2025

- Operationalized IFRS17 valuation reporting into a governed, automated pipeline, compressing reporting cycles from 60+ hours to ~10 minutes.
- Drove enterprise GenAI exploration from concept to executive decision — prototyping tool-enabled claims copilots and grounded RAG systems to inform investment and build-vs-buy strategy.
- Converted stakeholder ambiguity into prioritized roadmaps and measurable outcomes.

### Servian — Associate Consultant
Sydney, NSW | Mar 2022 – Nov 2023

- **News Corp AU (Recommendations):** Delivered a production-grade, end-to-end recommendation pipeline for real-time personalized news using **Python, AWS Lambda, FastAPI**, and scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **Pylon (Computer Vision):** Trained and deployed a rooftop segmentation model (Mask R-CNN + custom post-processing), achieving **0.73 mAP (bbox)** / **0.71 mAP (segmentation)** and **<300ms** inference.
- **Westpac (Remediation):** Supported remediation programs through data extraction, reconciliation, and analysis; contributed to triage/prioritization analysis across **10+ initiatives**, helping reduce operational cost and interest leakage (estimated **~$1M** impact).

## SELECTED PROJECTS

### Founder / AI Engineer — BrickAI (Consumer GenAI Agent for Property Search)
2025 – Present | www.thebrickai.com

- Built and launched a consumer-facing GenAI product for Australian property and suburb selection, achieving early user traction through trial onboarding and live demos.
- Presented BrickAI at the Actuarial Summit 2025 (~200 attendees, room at capacity) and multiple AI meetups, translating live user feedback into rapid roadmap iterations.
- Owned product and business end-to-end: strategy, positioning, GTM narrative, and a government grant submission (under review).
- Engineered the agentic core using OpenAI + tool/function calling with structured outputs (JSON), implementing trace-driven reliability improvements and production-grade logging.
