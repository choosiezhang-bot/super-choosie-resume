# Plan — Apply `resume_gaps_vs_openai_ai_deployment_engineer.md` to the resume

Target resume: `简历_openai_ade_2page.md`

This plan tracks each gap item and the concrete edits we will make. We will implement incrementally and commit changes in small, reviewable chunks.

## Gap 1) Executive Summary not maximally results-oriented

**Goal:** make the 3 lines after the hook read as **problem → impact → scope**, not capability/stack.

**Actions**
- [x] Remove stack-heavy phrasing from the intro.
- [x] Tighten the 1st sentence so it doesn’t start with generic “AI and data products”; lead with outcomes.
- [x] Ensure only numbers (DAU, cadence, time saved) appear in parentheses.

## Gap 2) Over-indexing on implementation details in high-visibility sections

**Goal:** keep the top of the resume outcome-first; move stack details into Experience.

**Actions**
- [x] Rewrite CORE SKILLS into role-oriented categories (deployment, enterprise delivery, engineering, cloud, data).
- [ ] In Projects, keep one technical bullet max; prioritize adoption/impact. (Next pass)

## Gap 3) Trusted advisor / backlog qualification story could be clearer

**Goal:** explicitly show discovery, qualification, ROI framing, and roadmap ownership.

**Actions**
- [x] Add a dedicated bullet under IAG covering use-case qualification + backlog + success criteria.
- [x] Add one “trusted advisor” bullet under Dataly that references discovery workshops + executive alignment (without over-claiming outcomes).

## Gap 4) Open-source / reusable resources underrepresented

**Goal:** show public artifacts + reusable assets.

**Actions**
- [x] Add a Resources section (Medium + resume repo).
- [ ] (Optional) add one more concrete artifact link if available (demo repo / notebook).

## Gap 5) Tenure mismatch (JD says 6+ years)

**Goal:** avoid over-claiming; compensate with senior scope + end-to-end ownership.

**Actions**
- [x] Present experience as ~5 years including internship experience.
- [x] Strengthen “end-to-end ownership” phrasing in 1–2 bullets (IAG + BrickAI).

## Gap 6) Dataly: avoid “POCs didn’t proceed” implication

**Goal:** frame as enabling decisions + reusable artifacts.

**Actions**
- [x] Keep build-vs-buy / ROI framing.
- [x] Add “codified learnings into reusable assets” bullet.

## Gap 7) Parentheses in summary should be numbers only

**Goal:** parentheses in intro only for impact numbers.

**Actions**
- [x] Summary parentheses are now only DAU/cadence/time savings.
- [ ] Re-check BrickAI line for parentheses that include non-numeric detail.
