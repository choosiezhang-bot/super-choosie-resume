# Resume gaps vs OpenAI AI Deployment Engineer JD (notes)

This is a candid “what’s missing / what to tighten” checklist against the JD.

## 1) Executive Summary is still not maximally results-oriented

- Current summary starts strong with a hook, but it still spends words on **capabilities/stack**.
- Recommendation: summary should read like **(problem → impact → scope)** first; put tech details later.
  - Example pattern: “Solved X for Y users in Z context; reduced A→B; shipped under governance (DAF, approval gates).”
  - Avoid: “delivering AI and data products… (long parenthetical stack)” in the intro.

## 2) Over-indexing on implementation details in high-visibility sections

- The JD expects architecture fluency, but it rewards **outcomes + adoption** more than a list of tools.
- Recommendation: move some details (K8s/Helm/New Relic/dbt/BigQuery) into **Experience bullets**, and keep summary lean.

## 3) “Trusted advisor / backlog qualification” story could be clearer

- You have real exec-facing impact (Command Centre, GM/CEO usage), but the resume doesn’t always explicitly say:
  - discovery workshops
  - use-case qualification
  - ROI framing
  - backlog/roadmap ownership
- Recommendation: add 1 bullet under IAG and/or Dataly that explicitly states:
  - “qualified use cases + built roadmap/backlog + defined success metrics”

## 4) Open-source / reusable resources (explicit JD bullet) is underrepresented

- JD explicitly asks: contribute to open-source and publish notebooks / best practices.
- You have a strong Medium article; consider adding either:
  - a “Resources” section with 1–2 repos/notebooks (even small), or
  - a bullet: “published internal playbooks / notebooks / templates” (if true).

## 5) Tenure mismatch (JD says 6+ years)

- Your experience reads ~4 years; that’s not fatal, but the resume must compensate by showing:
  - senior ownership
  - end-to-end delivery
  - stakeholder leadership
  - high throughput
- Recommendation: avoid over-claiming years; instead show senior scope and measurable outcomes.

## 6) Dataly section: be careful with “POCs didn’t proceed” implication

- It’s normal for POCs to stop, but the resume should frame this as:
  - enabling an informed decision (build vs buy / feasibility / ROI)
  - delivering reusable artifacts
- Recommendation: keep wording as “helped stakeholders evaluate feasibility/ROI and make build-vs-buy decisions.”

## 7) Minor: keep parentheses out of the summary unless they carry impact

- Parentheses in the intro should be reserved for **numbers** (DAU, refresh cadence, hours saved), not stack.
- Put stack/keywords into Skills + Experience.
