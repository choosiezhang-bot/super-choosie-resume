## EXPERIENCE

### IAG — Data Engineer (API, AI/LLM, Deployment)  
Sydney, NSW | Sep 2025 – Present

- Built a real-time situational awareness map for natural hazard events, adopted by **10–50** command-center / Claims / Customer Fulfilment users; reduced response decisions from **day-level to hour-level** and enabled outreach at scale (e.g., **millions of customers** in major hail events; **tens of thousands of policies** in bushfires).
- Built and maintained reusable, geo-enabled internal **REST APIs** and data services consumed across multiple business units (Claims, Pricing, and Code & Buy), designed as **agent-ready tools** for consistent reuse across applications, dashboards, and emerging AI/LLM workflows; focused on data enrichment (e.g., enhancing property and vehicle attributes) to improve decisioning and product experiences.
- Prototyped a multimodal (vision) AI experience (Home House Check) to help policyholders assess home issues and receive personalized maintenance guidance; led cross-functional discovery, partnered with customer teams, and engaged senior stakeholders (incl. C-level).

### Dataly — Senior Data/AI Consultant  
Sydney, NSW | Nov 2023 – Sep 2025

- Automated monthly IFRS17 valuation reporting for Suncorp NZ end-to-end, reducing cycle time from **60+ hours to ~10 minutes** and improving timeliness and reliability of regulatory reporting.
- Led multiple high-impact GenAI/ML **POCs** from discovery → prototype → executive-ready demos, including (1) **Text-to-SQL** + insurance data exploration dashboards, and (2) **claims decision support** using tool calling + OCR/Vision + **PDS-grounded RAG**.
- Played a hands-on role across architecture and implementation (Python + cloud), and drove pre-sales through solution storytelling, architecture walkthroughs, and stakeholder alignment on roadmaps and success metrics.

### Servian — Associate Consultant  
Sydney, NSW | Mar 2022 – Nov 2023

- **News Corp AU (Recommendations):** Delivered a production-grade, end-to-end recommendation pipeline for real-time personalized news using **Python, AWS Lambda, FastAPI**, and scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **Pylon (Computer Vision):** Trained and deployed a rooftop segmentation model for solar installation planning (Mask R-CNN + custom post-processing), achieving **0.73 mAP (bbox)** / **0.71 mAP (segmentation)** and **<300ms** inference.
- Additional experience: contributed to enterprise ML deployments across multiple clients (e.g., MLOps/CI-CD enablement and productionization support).

## DATA ENGINEERING (SELECTED)

- **Westpac:** Built and maintained production data pipelines and quality checks for customer remediation (ETL/ELT, reconciliation, data validation).
- **Suncorp NZ:** Delivered cloud data warehouse solutions and reporting automation (AWS Redshift), improving reliability and turnaround for recurring regulatory reporting cycles.
- **IAG:** Developed and supported reusable, geo-enabled REST APIs/data services for downstream teams to consume enriched datasets in applications and analytics workflows.

## PROJECTS

### AI Engineer — Dataly Insurance Claims RAG Pipeline  
Jun 2025 – Present

- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for insurance claims with custom chunking and retrieval strategies to improve answer relevance and accuracy.
- Developed a local knowledge base of insurance policies to enable secure, domain-specific retrieval without exposing sensitive data externally.
- Deployed a locally hosted Vision LLM to convert scanned insurance documents into structured data, automating manual workflows while maintaining data privacy.

### Founder / AI Engineer — BrickAI (Consumer AI Agent for Property Search)  
2025 – Present

- Built a consumer-facing web product for Australian property search and suburb selection (**www.thebrickai.com**), targeting **first-home buyers** and **property investors**; reached ~**200** trial users.
- Mission: reduce information asymmetry in property buying/investing and improve fairness in decision-making through transparent, personalized recommendations.
- Developed business and product strategy materials (pitch deck / business plan) to support government grant applications.
- Core experience: guided search and (planned) alerts—given a user’s constraints, the agent performs multi-step retrieval across property websites and internal datasets, then returns ranked, structured recommendations.
- Integrated multimodal signals (image understanding) to enrich property attributes and better match user-specific requirements.
- Coverage: broad suburb coverage across Australia; current architecture relies on near-real-time crawling/retrieval (with known latency trade-offs) while maintaining service availability.
- Current focus: consolidating and improving data coverage/quality to strengthen retrieval, ranking, personalization, and alert accuracy.

### AI Engineer — Dataly Property Buyer’s Agent
